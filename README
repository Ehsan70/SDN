Setting up a very simple controller using pox. 

#Requirements and Environment
You need python. I have tested my code on Ubuntu 14.  

#Setup
1. You first need to clone pox repository:
`git clone https://github.com/noxrepo/pox.git`
2. Then switch into `/pox/` directory and clone this repository: 
```
cd pox
git clone https://github.com/Ehsan70/SDN.git
```
3. The repo is cloned into the folder SDN. But you need to copy of the files in the `/SDN/` into `/ext/`. Or you can simply delete `/ext/` and rename `/SDN/` to `ext`.
It depends if you are already working on anything or not. I assume you are new, do the following:
```
# in the pox directory
rm -r ext/
mv SDN/ ext/
```
3. So now you have the files setup. Make sure you have the files from this repo in `ext` directory. The reason for that is the fact that 
pox assumes external files are places in that directory. 
You can run a `MyTest` controller by exceuting: 
```
# Move back to pox dir
cd ..
sudo ./pox.py MyTest
```
# Note 
At directory `pox/ext` you can make your own controler. This directory is not under version control for `pox`, so it makes a good place to
put your own projects.
